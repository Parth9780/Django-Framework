4>> What is Django URLs?make program to create django urls

Django URLs are a way to map URLs to views in a Django application. A URL pattern is a regular expression that Django compares to the URL of an incoming request. If it matches, Django calls the corresponding view function.

To create Django URLs, you need to define a list of URL patterns in the urls.py file of your application.

`urls.py`:
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('hello/', views.hello, name='hello'),
]
